# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
 ## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns using Python, SQL, and Power BI, identifying key factors influencing customer retention. The insights from this analysis can help businesses develop data-driven strategies to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

 Objectives

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure high-quality data

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover key churn drivers

Develop interactive dashboards in Power BI for real-time insights

Provide business recommendations to reduce customer churn

## Technologies Used

SQL: Querying and analyzing structured telecom customer data

Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards for business insights

### Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn labels. It includes key features such as:

Customer tenure (how long a customer has been with the company)

Monthly charges and total charges

Contract type (monthly, yearly, two-year plans)

Internet service type (DSL, fiber optic, no internet service)

Payment method (credit card, electronic check, bank transfer)

Customer support interactions

Churn label (Yes/No â€“ whether the customer has churned or not)

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identified churn trends based on different customer segments

Found that monthly contract customers have a significantly higher churn rate than those with long-term contracts

Discovered that higher monthly charges correlate with an increased churn probability

Observed that customers using fiber optic internet are more likely to churn than DSL users

Customer service interaction patterns indicate dissatisfaction in churned customers

 ### Power BI Dashboard

Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Churn trends over time

Impact of monthly charges and contract types on churn

Customer demographics vs. churn rate

Service usage insights to identify churn-prone customers

### Key Findings & Business Recommendations

Encourage long-term contracts: Customers on yearly/two-year plans churn less. Offering discounts or perks for longer commitments can reduce churn.

Target high-risk customers: Identify at-risk customers based on monthly charges, service type, and tenure, and offer personalized incentives.

Enhance customer support: Improve service response time and offer proactive support to customers likely to churn.

Optimize pricing models: Re-evaluate pricing for fiber optic services to make them more competitive.

Loyalty programs: Introduce rewards for customers staying beyond a certain period.
